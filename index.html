        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h3>Part 1: The Early Days</h3>
          <p>
            My interest in web development began when I was about 11 years old with my discovery of Neopets. I spent all of my free time using HTML and CSS to design pages dedicated to my 2-year Neopets obsession. My interests changed as I got older and I started designing templates for blogs on Xanga.com.
          </p>
          <h3>Part 2: Almost There</h3>
          <p>
            I ultimately decided to major in International Affairs, as I enjoy learning about other cultures and staying up-to-date on current events. I loved every minute of studying at Georgia Tech, because of its academic rigor and the fact that I was surrounded by incredibly smart people. Even though I was working on a liberal arts degree, I took an Intro to Programming class and loved it. After completing the course, I seriously considered changing my major to Computer Science, but I ultimately talked myself out of it because I was still set on my idea of being an ambassador of the world. Upon graduation, I landed a job at CNN, a company that I had dreamed of working at for years-- it was an exciting place to be and I loved that I was paid to learn about the rest of the world and pass the knowledge onto the rest of the world!
          </p>
          <h3>Part 3: Made It</h3>
          <p>
            After being promoted from Video Journalist to Associate Producer at CNN, I started pondering what my next step would be. I explored other opportunities within the company, but I just wasn't excited about any of them. And so, in May of 2015, I decided to explore web development again and see where it would take me. I started teaching myself using websites like Free Code Camp, Codecademy, Team Treehouse, and Code School. I looked forward to using my days off to build cool projects and attend coding meetups. I started looking into attending a coding bootcamp to expedite my programming education and, to make a long story short, I landed on App Academy's website and decided relatively quickly that that was where I was going. In the past year and a half I have learned so much, built so many cool projects, accumulated so many green squares, and discovered what I truly believe is my calling. I'm proud of everything I've managed to accomplish on my own so far-- please check out my portfolio and consider hiring me.
